<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>T</i></b></font>erry Pratchett's
eighth novel Guards! Guards! (1989) opened Discworld's popular
"Ankh-Morpork City Watch" police-procedural comic fantasies. Now Captain
Vimes and his motley watchmen go down those mean streets again in this
graphic adaptation, assisted in their enquiries by two of the usual
Pratchett Gang suspects: illustrator Graham Higgins, who drew the Mort
comic, and adaptor Stephen Briggs, who condenses Discworld into theatre
scripts.</p>
<p class="p">Fans will know the story by heart. Alcoholic Vimes,
corpulent coward Sergeant Colon and barely human runt Nobby are joined
by the huge, innocent new Watch recruit Carrot (a dwarf by adoption), as
Ankh-Morpork city enters a reign of terror. There's a ravaging dragon
about, whose flame doesn't just toast people but vaporises them. Behind
the dragon are its summoners, those hilariously seedy ritualists the
Elucidated Brethren of the Ebon Night. Behind the Brethren... but that
would be telling.</p>

<p class="p">Guards! Guards! is a substantial novel with a
serpentine plot; boiling it down to 122 pages of speech balloons and
glossy colour art must have been daunting. Some favourite Pratchett
lines and running gags were thrown to the wolves, but the streamlined
story still works well, and Higgins' quirky artwork adds a new
dimension. Wickedly funny details lurk in street and crowd scene
backgrounds. Eccentrics like Lady Sybil Ramkin, the "statueskew" dragon
breeder, would be easy to turn into caricatures but are given a proper
comic dignity.</p>

<p class="p">A highly enjoyable read--but funnier if you know the
original, where Pratchett had room to give his characters more depth.
