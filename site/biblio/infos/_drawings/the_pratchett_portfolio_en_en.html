<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><i><b>T</b></i></font>erry Pratchett's
incredible Discworld, floating through space on the backs of four
elephants standing on a giant turtle, supports some of the most popular
characters ever imagined in the world of fantasy fiction.</p>
<p class="p">But the Discworld people are real, even if their world
is a little... fantastic. Readers have their favourites and debates rage
as to exactly how they really look.</p>
<p class="p">Now they're here, warts (except in the case of Granny
Weatherwax) and all. Terry Pratchett and artist Paul Kidby have got
together to imagine everyone, from Rincewind the incompetent wizard to
Greebo the rather human cat, in sketches and fabulous full-colour
portraits.</p>
<p class="p">These are the Discworld people - REAL!</p>
