              and forger Moist van Lipwig is given a choice. Face the hangman's 
              noose, or get Ankh-Morpork's ancient post office up and running 
              efficiently! It was a tough decision... 
            <p class="p">Now, the former criminal is facing really big problems. 
              There's tons of undelivered mail. Ghosts are talking to him. One 
              of the postmen is 18,000 years old. And you really wouldn't want 
              to know what his new girlfriend can do with a shoe.
            <p class="p">To top it off, shadowy characters don't want the mail 
              moved. Instead, they want him dead -- deader than all those dead 
              letters. (And here he'd thought that all he'd have to face was rain, 
              snow, and gloom of night...)&quot;
