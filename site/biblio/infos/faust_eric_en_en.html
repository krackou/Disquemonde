 <p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i> E</i></b></font>ric is the Discworld's 
              only demonology hacker.
            <p class="p">Pity he's not very good at it.
            <p class="p">All he wants is three wishes granted. Nothing fancy - to be immortal, 
              rule the world, have the most beautiful woman in the world fall 
              madly in love with him, the usual stuff.
            <p class="p">But instead of a tractable demon, he calls up Rincewind, probably 
              the most incompetent wizard in the universe, and the extremely intractable 
              and hostile form of travel accessory known as the Luggage.
            <p class="p">With them on his side, Eric's in for a ride through space and time 
              that is bound to make him wish (quite fervently) again - this time 
              that he'd never been born.
