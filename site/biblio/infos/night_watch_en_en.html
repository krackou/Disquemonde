              of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch had it all. But now he's back inhis 
              own rough, tough past without even the clothes he was standing up 
              in when the lightning struck. 
            <p class="p">Living in the past is hard. Dying in the past is incredibly 
              easy. But he must survive, because he has a job to do. He must track 
              down a murderer, teach his younger self how to be a good copper 
              and change the outcome of a bloody rebellion. There's a problem: 
              if he wins, he's got no wife, no child, no future.

              urchins, ladies of negotiable affection, rebels, secret policemen 
              and other children of the revolution.
