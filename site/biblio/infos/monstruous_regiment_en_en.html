<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i> I</i></b></font>t was a sudden 
              strange fancy... 
            <p class="p">Polly Perks had to become a boy in a hurry. Cutting off 
              her hair and wearng trousers was easy. Learning to fart and belch 
              in public and walk like an ape took more time...
            <p class="p">And now she's enlisted in the army, and searching for 
              her lost brother. But there's a war on. There's always a war on. 
              And Polly and her fellow recruits are suddenly in the thick of it, 
              without any training, and the enemy is hunting them.
            <p class="p">All they have on their side is the most artful sergeant 
              in the army and a vampire with a lust for coffee. Well... they have 
              the Secret. And as they take the war to the heart of the enemy, 
              they have to use all the resources of... the Monstrous Regiment.
