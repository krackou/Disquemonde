            <p class="p">Everyone Knows It Has To Be Managed.
            <p class="p">And on Discworld that is the job of the Monks of History, who store 
              it and pump it from the places it's wasted (like underwater - how 
              much time does a codfish need?) to places like cities, where there's 
              never enough time.
            <p class="p">But the construction of the world's first truly accurate clock 
              starts a race against, well, time for Lu Tze and his apprentice 
              Lobsang Ludd. Because it will stop time. And that will be only the 
              start of everyone's problems.
            <p class="p">The Thief Of Time comes complete with a full supporting cast of
