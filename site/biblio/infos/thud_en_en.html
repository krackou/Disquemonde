<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>K</i></b></font>oom Valley? That 
              was where the trolls ambushed the dwarves, or the dwarves ambushed 
              the trolls. It was far away. It was a long time ago.
            <p class="p"> But if he doesn't solve the murder of just one dwarf, 
              Commander Sam Vimes of Ankh-Morpork City Watch is going to see the 
              battle fought again, right outside his office.</p>
            <p class="p"> With his beloved Watch crumbling around him and war-drums 
              sounding, he must unravel every clue, outwit every assassin and 
              brave any darkness to find the solution. And darkness is following 
              him.</p>
