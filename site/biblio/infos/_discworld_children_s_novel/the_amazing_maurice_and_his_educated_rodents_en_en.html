              clever rats. Rats that don't run. Rats that fight... 
            <p class="p">Maurice, a scruffy tomcat with an eye for the main chance, 
              has the perfect fiddle going. He has a stupid-looking kid for a 
              piper, and he has his very own plague of rats - rats who are strangely 
              educated, so Maurice can no longer think of them as 'lunch'. And 
              everyone knows the stories about rats and pipers - and is giving 
              him lots of money...

              Blintz, and the nice little con suddenly goes down the drain. 
            <p class="p">Someone there is playing a different tune. A dark, shadowy 
              tune. Something very, very bad is waiting in the cellars. The rats 
              must learn a new word. 
            <p class="p">Evil. 
            <p class="p">It's not a game any more. 
            <p class="p">It's definitely a rat-eat-rat world down there. In fact, 
              that might only be the start...
