<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>T</i></b></font>here's trouble 
              on the Aching farm -- a monster in the river, a headless horseman 
              in the driveway and nightmares spreading down from the hills. And 
              now Tiffany Aching's little brother has been stolen by the Queen 
              of the Fairies (although Tiffany doesn't think this is entirely 
              a bad thing).
            <p class="p">Tiffany's got to get him back. To help her, she ha a 
              weapon (a frying pan), her granny's magic book (well, _Diseases 
              of the Sheep_, actually) and --
            <p class="p">'Crivens! Whut aboot us ye daftie!'
            <p class="p">-- oh yes. She's also got the Nac Mac Feegle, the Wee 
              Free Men, the fightin', thievin', tiny blue-skinned pictsies who 
              were thrown out of Fairyland for being Drunk and Disorderly...
            <p class="p">A wise, witty and wonderfully inventive adventure set 
              on the Discworld.
