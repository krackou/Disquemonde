              GET GIVEN XYLOPHONES. SUSAN JUST HAD TO ASK HER GRANDFATHER TO TAKE 
              HIS VEST OFF.
            <p class="p">Yes. There's a Death in the Family.
            <p class="p">It's hard to grow up normally when Grandfather rides a white horse 
              and wields a scythe - especially when you have to take over the 
              family business, and everyone mistakes you for the Tooth Fairy.
            <p class="p">And especially when you have to face the new and addictive music 
              that has entered Discworld.
            <p class="p">It's lawless. It changes people.
            <p class="p">It's called Music with Rocks In.
            <p class="p">It's got a beat and you can dance to it, but...
            <p class="p">It's alive.
            <p class="p">And it won't fade away.
