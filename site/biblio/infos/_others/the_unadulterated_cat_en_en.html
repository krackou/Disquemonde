            <p class="p">Real cats never eat from bowls (at least, not the ones marked CAT).
            <p class="p">Real cats never wear flea collars... or appear on birthday cards... 
              or chase anything with a bell in it.
            <p class="p">Real cats do eat quiche. And giblets. And butter. And anything 
              else left on the table. They can hear a fridge door opening two 
              rooms away.
            <p class="p">Real cats don't need names. But they often get called them.
