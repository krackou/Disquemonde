<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i> H</i></b></font>e's been a legend 
              in his own lifetime.
            <p class="p">He can remember the great days of high adventure.
            <p class="p">He can remember when a hero didn't have to worry about fences and 
              lawyers and civilisation.
            <p class="p">He can remember when people didn't tell you off for killing dragons
            <p class="p">But he can't always remember, these days, where he put his teeth...
            <p class="p">He's really not happy about that bit.
            <p class="p">So now, with his ancient sword and his new walking stick and his 
              old friends - and they're very old friends - Cohen the Barbarian 
              is going on one final quest. It's been a good life. He's going to 
              climb the highest mountain in the Discworld and meet his gods. He 
              doesn't like the way they let men grow old and die
            <p class="p">It's time, in fact, to give something back.
            <p class="p">The last hero in the world is going to return what the first hero 
              stole. With a vengeance. That'll mean the end of the world, if no 
              one stops him in time.
            <p class="p">Someone is going to try. So who knows who the last hero really 
              is?
