<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>N</i></b></font>ot only an
artistic and breathtaking view of Lancre but also an interesting and
informative guide to one of the Discworld's more, er, picturesque
kingdoms.</p>
<p class="p">Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick live
there. Lancre could Hardly be somewhere ordinary, could it?</p>
<p class="p">Magic glues the Discworld together and a lot of it ends
up in Lancre, principal Kingdom of the Ramtop Mountains. Between
&Uuml;berwald and Whale Bay, the Octarine Grass Country and the
Widdershins Ocean lies the most exciting and dangerous terrain in all
Discworld. The Ramtops supply Discworld with most of its witches and
wizards. The leaves on the trees in the Ramtops move even when there is
no breeze. Rocks go for a stroll in the evening. Even the land, at
times, seems alive.</p>
<p class="p">The mapp may only be two-dimensional, but watch it very
carefully and you might see it jostle about a bit.</p>

is Britain's most successful author of comic fantasy, probably the
hardest-working writer in the business and a generally all-round good
chap.</p>
<p align="center"><b>STEPHEN BRIGGS</b><br />
is none of these, but knows even more about Discworld than Mr Pratchett
which is, when you think about it, very odd.</p>
