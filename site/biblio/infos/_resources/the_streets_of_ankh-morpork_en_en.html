THAT ALL ROADS LEAD TO ANKH-MORPORK. AND IT'S WRONG. ALL ROADS LEAD AWAY
FROM ANKH-MORPORK, BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST WALK ALONG THEM THE WRONG
WAY' from Moving Pictures</p>
<p class="p">Ankh-Morpork! City of One Thousand Surprises (according
to the famous publication by the Guild of Merchants)! All human life is
there! Altough, if it walks down the wrong alley, often quiet briefly!</p>
<p class="p">The city celebrated in the bestselling Discworld&reg;
series by Terry Pratchett has been meticulously mapped for the first
time. It's all here - from Unseen University to the Shades, from major
landmarks like the Patrician's Palace to the little-known, er, nooks the
Dwarf Bread Museum in Whirligig Alley. See the famous streets along
which so many heroes have walked, in some cases quite hurriedly!</p>
<p class="p">As leading Ankh-Morpork entrepreneur C.M.O.T. Dibbler
would say : A snip at any price - and that's cutting my own throat.
