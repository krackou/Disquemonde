<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>I</i></b></font>n the fantasy
universe of the phenomenally best-selling Discworld series, everything
runs on magic and common sense. The world is flat and million-to-one
chances happen nine times out of ten. Our world seems different - it
runs on rules, often rather strange ones. Science is our way of finding
out what those rules are. The appeal of Discworld is that it mostly
makes sense, in a way that particle physics doesn't.</p>
<p class="p">The Science of Discworld uses the magic of Discworld to
illuminate the scientific rules that govern our world. When a wizardly
experiment goes adrift, the wizards of Unseen University find themselves
with a pocket universe on their hands: Round-world, where neither magic
nor common sense seem to stand a chance against logic.</p>
<p class="p">Roundworld is, of course, our own universe. With us
inside it (eventually). Guided (if that's the word) by wizards, we
follow its story from the primal singularity of the Big Bang to the
Internet and beyond. We discover how puny and insignificant individual
lives are against a cosmic backdrop of creation and disaster. Yet,
paradoxically, we see how the richness of a universe based on rules has
led to a complex world and at least one species that tried to get a grip
on what was going on...</p>
