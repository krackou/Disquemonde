<p align="center">It's no more than a breath away...</p>
<p class="p">Everyone needs a place to relax after a long day, after
all. So here is the place where the Grim Reaper can kick back and take
the load off his scythe. Here's the golf course that's not so much crazy
as insane, and the useless maze, and the dark gardens - all brought
(incongruously) to life. And here, for the first time ever, you will
find out the reason why Death can't understand rockeries, and what
happens to garden gnomes.</p>
<p class="p">As Death rides Binky into the sunset (of other people's
lives), you can at last see what he gets up to when he's not at work.</p>
