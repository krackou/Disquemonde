<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>T</i></b></font>he Discworld can
be a hazardous and confusing planet : the whole place fair crackles with
raw magic and mayhem. For safety's sake, you need an expert companion.</p>
<p class="p">So, Terry Pratchett and Stephen Briggs, respectively
chronicler and cartographer, have helpfully produced this, the one and
only definitive guide to the flat planet - its geography, its flora and
fauna, its (many) religions, its architecture and customs, and, of
course its outsanding personalities.</p>
<p class="p">If you need to know what Death keeps on his desk, or
what Bestiality Carter does for a living, or for the really adventurous,
where to get a curry in Ankh-Morpork*, or indeed, anything else about
the Discworld, then this is a book for you.</p>
<p class="p">Complete with illustrations, maps and significant
emblems of Discworld heraldy.</p>
<p class="p">* Klatchian Curry Gardens, corner of God Street and
Blood Alley. Don't use the kitchen entrance.<br />
