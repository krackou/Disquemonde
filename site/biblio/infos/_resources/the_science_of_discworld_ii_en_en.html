<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>R</i></b></font>oundworld is in
trouble again, and this time it looks fatal. Having created it in the
first place, the wizards of Unseen University feel vaguely responsible
for its safety. They know the creatures who lived there escaped the
impending Big Freeze by inventing the space elevator - they even
intervened to rid the planet of a plague of elves, who attempted to
divert humanity onto a different time track.</p>
<p>But now it's all gone wrong - Victorian England has stagnated and
the pace of progress would embarrass a limping snail. Unless something
drastic is done, there won't be time for anyone to invent spaceflight
and the human race will be turned into ice-pops. Why, though, did
history come adrift? Was it Sir Arthur Nightingale's dismal book about
natural selection? Or was it the devastating response by an obscure
country vicar called Charles Darwin, whose bestselling Theology of
Species made it impossible to refute the divine design of living
creatures? Either way, it's no easy task to change history, as the
wizards discover to their cost. Can the God of Evolution come to
humanity's aid and ensure Darwin writes a very different book? And who
stopped him writing it in the first place?</p>
