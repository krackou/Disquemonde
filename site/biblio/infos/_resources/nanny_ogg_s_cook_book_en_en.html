the way to a man's heart is through his stomach which just goes to show
they're as confused about anatomy as they gen'rally are about everything
else, unless they're talking about instructions on how to stab him, in
which case a better way is up and under the ribcage. Anyway, we do not
live in a perfect world and it is foresighted and useful for a young
woman to become proficient in those arts which will keep a weak-willed
man from straying. Learning to cook is also useful.'</p>
<p class="p">Nanny Ogg, one of Discworld&#8217;s most famous
witches, has decided to pass on some of her huge collection of tasty and
exceedingly interesting recipes. In addition to the delights of the
Strawberry Wobbler and Nobby&#8217;s Mum&#8217;s Distressed Pudding, Mrs
Ogg imparts her thoughts on life, death, etiquette, courtship, children
and weddings, all in a refined style that should not offend the most
delicate of sensibilities. Well, not much...</p>
<p>Most of the recipes have been tried out on people who are still
alive.</p>
<p>Mrs Ogg gratefully acknowledges the assistance of Mr. Terry
Pratchett, Mr. Stephen Briggs, Mlle Tina Hannan and Master Paul Kidby.</p>
