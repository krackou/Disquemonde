              REVOLUTION! DEATH! WAR! (AND HIS SONS TERROR AND PANIC, AND DAUGHTER 
              CLANCY).
            <p class="p">The oldest and most inscrutable empire on the Discworld is in turmoil, 
              brought about by the revolutionary treatise What I Did On My Holidays. 
              Workers are uniting, with nothing to lose but their water buffaloes. 
              War (and Clancy) are spreading through the ancient cities.
            <p class="p">And all that stands in the way of terrible doom for everyone is:
            <p class="p">Rincewind the Wizard, who can't even spell the word `wizard'...
            <p class="p">Cohen the barbarian hero, five foot tall in his surgical sandals, 
              who has had a lifetime's experience of not dying...
            <p class="p">...and a very special butterfly.
