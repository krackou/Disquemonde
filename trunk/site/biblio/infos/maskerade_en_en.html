 <p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i> T</i></b></font>he Opera House, 
              Ankh Morpork...
            <p class="p">...a huge, rambling building, where innocent young sopranos 
              are lured to their destiny by an evil mastermind in a hideously 
              deformed evening dress...
            <p class="p">At least, he hopes so. But Granny Weatherwax, Discworld's most 
              famous witch, is in the audience. And she doesn't hold with that 
              sort of thing.
            <p class="p">So there's going to be trouble (but nevertheless a good evening's 
              entertainment with murders you can really hum...)</p>
