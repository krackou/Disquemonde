University sits in the centre of Discworld's greatest city,
Ankh-Morpork. Some would say it is the very heart of the city. Ancient
and magical, it is the home to the greatest library in the multiverse
and the oldest building on the Discworld, the soaring Tower of Art.
Enjoy the challenge of making all seven buildings and seeing the
complete Unseen University literally unfold before your eyes. It is
created in perfect detail by renowned illustrator and modelmaker, Alan
Batley, from the original sculpture of the University by Discworld
Artist Bernard Pearson. This title includes a foreword by Terry
Pratchett. Simple tools, patience, and a good pot of glue are all that
is required to create this masterpiece. With comprehensive and
easy-to-follow instructions throughout, this title is suitable for all
from 10 up, including the adult serious model maker.</p>
