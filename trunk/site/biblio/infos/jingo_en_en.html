              TO WAR, WITH ARMIES OF SARDINESS, WARRIORS, FISHERMEN, SQUID AND 
              AT LEAST ONE VERY CAMP FOLLOWER. 
            <p class="p">As two armies march, Commander Vimes of Ankh-Morpork City Watch 
              faces unpleasant foes who are out to get him... and that's just 
              the people on his side. The enemy might be even worse.

              series, makes the World Cup look like a friendly five-a-side.
            <p class="p">'Pratchett's writting is a constant delight. No one mixes the fantastical 
              and mundane to better comic effect or offers sharper insights into 
              the absurdities of human endeavour.'
            <p class="p">'Both his inventiveness and his moral shrewdness seem inexhaustible.'
