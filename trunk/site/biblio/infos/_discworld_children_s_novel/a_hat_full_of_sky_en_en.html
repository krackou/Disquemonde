<p class="p1"><font size="+2"><b><i>A</i></b></font> real witch can
ride a broomstick, cast spells and make a proper shamble out of nothing.</p>
<p class="p"><em>Eleven-year-old Tiffany Aching can't.</em></p>
<p class="p">A real witch never casually steps out of her body,
leaving it empty.</p>
<p class="p"><em>Tiffany does.</em></p>
<p class="p">And there's something just waiting for a handy body to
take over. Something ancient and horrible, which can't die.</p>

witch really quickly, with the help of arch-witch Mistress Weatherwax
and the truly amazing Miss Level...</p>
<p class="p">-- &quot;Crivens! And us!&quot;</p>
<p class="p">Oh, yes. And the Nac Mac Feegle -- the rowdiest, toughest,
smelliest bunch of fairies ever to be thrown out of Fairyland for being
drunk at two in the afternoon. They'll fight anything.</p>
<p class="p">And even they might not be enough...</p>
