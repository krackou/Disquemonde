DISCWORLD, Terry Pratchett takes us on a guided tour of the Discworld,
courtesy of his favourite Discworld artist, Paul Kidby. Following on
from THE LAST HERO, THE ART OF DISCWORLD is a lavish 112-page large
format, sumptuously illustrated look at all things Discworldian. Terry
Pratchett provides the written descriptions while Paul Kidby illustrates
the world that has made Pratchett one of the best-selling authors of all
time. Here you will find favourites old and new: the City Watch,
including Vimes, Carrot and Angua, the three witches - Granny
Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick - and the denizens of the
Unseen University Library, not forgetting the Librarian, of course:
they're all here in sumptuous colour, together with the places:
Ankh-Morpork, Lancre, Uberwald and more ...No Discworld fan will want to
be without this beautiful gift book.</p>
